                PinkBlue began as a heartfelt response to witnessing the courage of those facing cancer. 
                What started as the Pink Ribbon Drive has blossomed into something much greaterâ€”a movement 
                that embraces not just the color of awareness, but the full spectrum of healing.
              </p>
              <p className="text-warm-gray leading-relaxed mb-8">
                The addition of blue represents peace, tranquility, and the calm strength needed during 
                life's most challenging moments. Together, pink and blue create a harmony that speaks 
                to both the warrior spirit and the gentle healing required on this journey.
